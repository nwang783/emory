# @emory/desktop

Electron desktop application for the Emory face recognition system. Built with electron-vite, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

The desktop app is the primary Emory client: it captures webcam frames, runs SCRFD detection and ArcFace embedding extraction via `@emory/core`, matches against embeddings in `@emory/db`, and renders live overlays with a **sidebar-driven layout**: **Camera → People → Connections → Activity → Analytics → Embeddings → Settings**. `LivenessService` and `AppearanceService` from `@emory/core` are available for pipeline integration but are **not** invoked from the default `face:*` IPC handlers in this release.

**Active learning** (optional): when enabled, the renderer can request new embeddings for recognized faces at different poses; the main process enforces cooldown, diversity, and per-person caps before persisting rows with source `auto_learn` (see [Active learning](#active-learning)).

### Layers

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Main Process** (`src/main/`) | Electron app lifecycle, IPC handler registration, service orchestration. Uses `@emory/core` for face processing and `@emory/db` for persistence. On **`before-quit`**, stops `CleanupService` and calls **`disposeFaceService()`** from `ipc/face.ipc.ts` to release ONNX `InferenceSession` instances (best-effort, fire-and-forget). |
| **Services** (`src/main/services/`) | Background services running in the main process. `CleanupService` runs a daily data retention job that deletes old encounters and unknown sightings based on user-configured retention policies stored in `retention_config`. |
| **IPC Handlers** (`src/main/ipc/`) | Bridge between renderer requests and backend services. `db.ipc.ts` wraps `PeopleRepository` (people + embeddings CRUD, **`db:people:get-self`** / **`db:people:set-self`** for the connection-web “me” person), `RelationshipRepository` (**duplicate pair rejected** on create), and `RetentionRepository`; `encounter.ipc.ts` wraps `EncounterRepository` (session + encounter lifecycle); `face.ipc.ts` wraps `FaceService` plus auto-learn persistence rules (cooldown, diversity, caps, server-side embedding verification); `unknown.ipc.ts` wraps `UnknownSightingRepository` for tracking unrecognized faces. |
| **Preload** (`src/preload/`) | Context bridge exposing `window.emoryApi` with typed methods. Converts `ArrayBuffer` to `Uint8Array` for IPC serialization. |
| **Renderer** (`src/renderer/`) | React UI. Domain modules (`camera`, `people`, `connections`, `embeddings`, `settings`, `activity`, `analytics`) plus shared layout components and Zustand stores. |

### Face engine shutdown

`src/main/index.ts` registers `app.on('before-quit', …)` which invokes **`disposeFaceService()`** from `ipc/face.ipc.ts`. That function awaits `FaceService.dispose()` (releases SCRFD and ArcFace ONNX sessions) and clears the module-level `faceService` reference. Errors are swallowed (`.catch(() => {})`) so quit is not blocked.

## Data retention

`CleanupService` (`src/main/services/cleanup.service.ts`) runs a periodic cleanup job in the Electron main process to delete old data based on user-configured retention policies.

### How it works

1. **Startup:** `CleanupService` is instantiated in `main/index.ts` after `registerDbIpc()` returns the repositories. It runs an immediate cleanup, then schedules a repeat every 24 hours.
2. **Shutdown:** The `before-quit` handler calls `cleanupService.stop()` to clear the interval timer.
3. **Per-run:** The service reads all rows from `retention_config` (via `RetentionRepository.getAll()`) and processes each:

| `entityType` | Repository method | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `encounters` | `EncounterRepository.deleteOldEncounters(days, keepImportant)` | When `keepImportant` is true, encounters marked as important are preserved regardless of age |
| `unknown_sightings` | `UnknownSightingRepository.deleteOldSightings(days)` | Only deletes sightings with status other than `tracking` |

### Settings UI

The **Data Retention** card in `SettingsPanel` exposes:

| Control | Range | Default | Persisted as |
|---|---|---|---|
| Encounter Retention (slider) | 7–365 days | 90 | `retention_config` row with `entity_type = 'encounters'` |
| Keep Important Encounters (toggle) | on/off | on | `keep_important` column on the `encounters` row |
| Unknown Sightings Retention (slider) | 7–90 days | 30 | `retention_config` row with `entity_type = 'unknown_sightings'` |

Changes are persisted immediately via `db:retention:upsert` IPC and take effect on the next cleanup run. The **Settings** retention card loads config with a `.catch` so a failed `db:retention:get-all` still marks the panel loaded (defaults apply); `upsert` failures are caught so sliders do not surface errors. **Analytics** wraps its parallel people / encounter / unknown loads in `try`/`finally` so a failed fetch clears the loading state without throwing to the console.

## Active learning

End-to-end flow:

1. **Detection loop** (`WebcamFeed`) calls `face:detect-only` on a short interval (`detectCooldownMs` from `settings.store`) to update face tracks and overlay FPS.
2. **Identification loop** runs on `identifyIntervalMs` and calls `face:process-frame` to match faces and update `matches`.
3. When **auto-learn** is enabled in settings, a matched track can trigger `face:extract-embedding` then `face:auto-learn` with the new vector. The renderer also requires a **per-track** minimum gap (~15s) and a similarity band (see `WebcamFeed.tsx` constants) before attempting extraction.
4. **Main process** (`face.ipc.ts`) applies:

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Cooldown per `personId` | 10s between successful learn attempts |
| Embedding quality | `validateEmbedding` from `@emory/core`: reject invalid vectors (`reason: 'error'`); reject when `qualityScore < 0.5` (`reason: 'too_similar'`) |
| Diversity | **Manual** (registration) rows: skip if cosine similarity **≥ 0.85** to any such embedding. **Auto-learn** rows: skip if similarity **≥ 0.80** (0.85 − 0.05) to any `auto_learn` embedding — stricter separation from registration, slightly looser among auto-learned samples |
| Auto-learn cap | Max **15** embeddings with `source = auto_learn`; when full, **oldest** `auto_learn` row is deleted and replaced |
| Total cap | Max **20** embeddings per person across all sources; if at cap, new stores are rejected unless replacing an auto-learn slot as above |
| **Renderer gate (hardened)** | Auto-learn only when **similarity ≥ 0.60**, **match margin ≥ 0.06**, identity held **≥ 30s**, **5/8 vote consensus** for the same person, and track is **not** in the confused state (see [Recognition safety](#recognition-safety)). |
| **Server verification** | Before persist, re-match the new embedding against that person’s **existing** embeddings: require **min similarity ≥ 0.45** to at least one stored vector; **reject** if computed margin **< 0.06** (ambiguous vs other identities). |

Face **thumbnails** (128×128 JPEG, base64) and **quality scores** are stored on embedding rows when registration or auto-learn persists (see `@emory/db` schema V3).

Results are returned as `AutoLearnResult` from `@emory/core` (`learned`, `personId`, `reason`). Successful learns increment `activity.store` (`autoLearnCount`, `events`) and feed the **Activity** tab and **StatusBar** / camera badge.

## Recognition safety

Defaults in `@emory/core` (`face.service.ts`): **`DEFAULT_MATCH_THRESHOLD` is `0.45`** (raised from `0.4`). UI settings still sync `matchThreshold` via `face:update-thresholds`.

### Match margin in votes

Identity votes record **`matchMargin`** from each identification pass. **Instant lock** (high-confidence bypass) requires **margin ≥ 0.08**. **Vote-based lock** requires **margin ≥ 0.05** in addition to consistent votes.

### Confusion / oscillation

If **3+ distinct people** appear among the **last 8** identity votes, the track enters a **confused** state: **yellow “?” overlay** for **10 seconds**. Auto-learn is suppressed while confused.

### Faster unknown / unlock

- **`unknownStreak`** increments by **1.0** on weak matches and **2.0** on no match.
- **`IDENTITY_UNLOCK_VOTES`** is **4** (reduced from 5).

### Confident unknown

Matches with **similarity below 0.42** are treated as **no match** (same as “no candidate”): the overlay shows **“Unknown”** instead of **“Detecting…”**.

## Identity locking (v2)

Per-track identity in the camera overlay (`WebcamFeed.tsx`) uses a stricter locking model so labels do not stick on weak or ambiguous matches.

| Constant | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `INSTANT_LOCK_THRESHOLD` | `0.55` | Only very high-confidence first matches bypass voting |
| `MIN_VOTES_TO_LOCK` | `3` | Minimum consistent votes required before locking identity |
| `WEAK_MATCH_THRESHOLD` | `0.48` | Matches below this do not count toward identity locking |
| `SIMILARITY_DECAY_THRESHOLD` | `0.45` | If recent match average drops below this, identity unlocks |
| `AUTO_LEARN_MIN_SIMILARITY` | `0.60` (with margin ≥ 0.06, time/vote gates — see [Active learning](#active-learning)) | Prevents auto-learning from low-quality or ambiguous matches |

**Correction:** If a different person starts winning votes, identity can switch to that person.

**Weak band:** Matches in **0.42–0.48** are still recorded on the track but treated as partial unknown evidence (they do not contribute like strong matches for lock progression). Below **0.42**, see [Confident unknown](#confident-unknown).

## Voice response ("Who is that?")

The camera view includes a **"Who is that?"** button that announces identified people using the Web Speech API.

### Flow

1. User clicks the button while the camera is active.
2. `WebcamFeed` maintains an `identifiedPeople` state array, updated at the end of every identification pass from the current face tracks.
3. `WhoIsThisButton` receives this array and builds a spoken announcement based on confidence tiers:

| Similarity | Announcement style |
|---|---|
| **≥ 0.65** | "That's **{name}**." (includes relationship if set) |
| **≥ 0.50** | "I think that's **{name}**." |
| **< 0.50** | "I'm not sure, but it might be **{name}**." |

4. If no one is identified: "I don't recognise anyone right now."
5. Clicking again while speech is active cancels it immediately.

### Voice service (`shared/lib/voice.ts`)

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `speak(text, rate?)` | Returns a `Promise<void>` that resolves when speech ends. Cancels any in-progress speech first. Prefers a local English voice. |
| `isSpeaking()` | Returns `true` while an utterance is active |
| `stopSpeaking()` | Cancels current speech immediately |

## Match margin

Each `FaceMatch` from `face:process-frame` includes **`matchMargin`** (see `@emory/core`):

- Computed as the similarity **gap** between the best match and the **second-best** match **among distinct people** (not among raw embedding rows).
- **Per-person aggregation:** each registered person may have multiple embeddings; matching first takes the **best** similarity per person, then ranks people and computes margin from the top two people.
- **Use:** Surfaces ambiguous cases where one face scores similarly against several registered identities (low margin), versus a clear winner (high margin).
- **Identity pipeline:** margin is **tracked per vote** and gates instant vs vote-based locks (see [Recognition safety](#recognition-safety)).

## IPC API

### Face Operations

| Channel | Direction | Payload | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `face:initialize` | Renderer → Main | — | `{ success, error?, provider? }` |
| `face:detect-only` | Renderer → Main | `Uint8Array, width, height` | `{ detections, processingTimeMs }` |
| `face:process-frame` | Renderer → Main | `Uint8Array, width, height` | `FaceProcessingResult` |
| `face:register` | Renderer → Main | `personId, Uint8Array, width, height, source` | `{ success, embeddingId?, error?, similarWarning? }` |
| `face:auto-learn` | Renderer → Main | `personId, embedding: number[]` | `AutoLearnResult` |
| `face:extract-embedding` | Renderer → Main | `Uint8Array, width, height` | `{ embedding, bbox } \| null` |
| `face:get-embedding-count` | Renderer → Main | `personId` | `number` |
| `face:update-thresholds` | Renderer → Main | `detectionThreshold, matchThreshold` | `void` |

`source` for `face:register` is `'photo_upload' | 'live_capture'` (registration only). Auto-learned rows use `auto_learn` via `face:auto-learn`.

After extracting the embedding, registration compares it against all stored embeddings (excluding the same `personId`), taking the **best** similarity per other person. If any person reaches cosine similarity ≥ **0.55**, the response includes `similarWarning: { similarPersonId, similarPersonName, similarity }`. Registration still succeeds and the embedding is saved; the warning is for the UI to surface a “possibly duplicate identity” message.

### Database Operations

| Channel | Direction | Payload | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `db:people:create` | Renderer → Main | `CreatePersonInput` | `Person` |
| `db:people:find-all` | Renderer → Main | — | `Person[]` |
| `db:people:find-by-id` | Renderer → Main | `id` | `Person \| null` |
| `db:people:update` | Renderer → Main | `id, UpdatePersonInput` | `Person \| null` |
| `db:people:delete` | Renderer → Main | `id` | `boolean` |
| `db:people:merge` | Renderer → Main | `keepId, mergeId` | `Person \| null` |
| `db:people:update-profile` | Renderer → Main | `id, { keyFacts?, conversationStarters?, importantDates?, lastTopics? }` | `Person \| null` |

### Relationship Operations

| Channel | Direction | Payload | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `db:relationships:create` | Renderer → Main | `personAId, personBId, type, notes?` | `Relationship` |
| `db:relationships:get-by-person` | Renderer → Main | `personId` | `RelationshipWithPerson[]` |
| `db:relationships:get-all` | Renderer → Main | — | `Relationship[]` via `RelationshipRepository.findAll()` |
| `db:relationships:update` | Renderer → Main | `id, type?, notes?` | `Relationship \| null` |
| `db:relationships:delete` | Renderer → Main | `id` | `boolean` |

`db:relationships:create` and `db:relationships:update` accept a string `type` from the renderer; the main process normalises it to `RelationshipType` from `@emory/db` (`spouse`, `child`, `parent`, `sibling`, `friend`, `carer`, `neighbour`, `colleague`, `other`). Unknown values are stored as `other`.

### Embedding Operations (gallery / admin)

| Channel | Direction | Payload | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `db:embeddings:get-by-person` | Renderer → Main | `personId` | Embeddings with metadata for one person |
| `db:embeddings:delete` | Renderer → Main | embedding id(s) | Success / updated rows |
| `db:embeddings:reassign` | Renderer → Main | embedding id, target `personId` | Updated embedding |
| `db:embeddings:get-all-grouped` | Renderer → Main | — | All embeddings grouped by person (for **Embeddings** tab) |

### Retention Operations

| Channel | Direction | Payload | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `db:retention:get-all` | Renderer → Main | — | `RetentionConfig[]` |
| `db:retention:upsert` | Renderer → Main | `entityType, retentionDays, keepImportant` | `RetentionConfig` |

### Encounter Operations

| Channel | Direction | Payload | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `encounter:start-session` | Renderer → Main | `deviceId?` | `{ success, session? , error? }` |
| `encounter:end-session` | Renderer → Main | — | `{ success, session?, error? }` |
| `encounter:get-active-session` | Renderer → Main | — | `string \| null` |
| `encounter:log` | Renderer → Main | `personId, confidence` | `Encounter \| null` |
| `encounter:end` | Renderer → Main | `personId` | `Encounter \| null` |
| `encounter:mark-important` | Renderer → Main | `encounterId, important` | `Encounter \| null` |
| `encounter:get-by-person` | Renderer → Main | `personId, limit?` | `EncounterWithPerson[]` |
| `encounter:get-recent` | Renderer → Main | `limit?` | `EncounterWithPerson[]` |
| `encounter:count-by-person` | Renderer → Main | `personId, sinceDays?` | `number` |

Session state is managed in-process: `encounter:start-session` stores the active session ID, and `encounter:log` / `encounter:end` operate against it. Only one session can be active at a time.

### Unknown Person Tracking Operations

| Channel | Direction | Payload | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `unknown:track` | Renderer → Main | `tempId, embeddingData?: number[], confidence?` | `UnknownSighting \| null` |
| `unknown:get-active` | Renderer → Main | — | `UnknownSighting[]` |
| `unknown:get-all` | Renderer → Main | `limit?` | `UnknownSighting[]` |
| `unknown:get-active-count` | Renderer → Main | — | `number` |
| `unknown:dismiss` | Renderer → Main | `id` | `UnknownSighting \| null` |
| `unknown:name-as-person` | Renderer → Main | `id, personId` | `UnknownSighting \| null` |
| `unknown:find-by-id` | Renderer → Main | `id` | `UnknownSighting \| null` |

`unknown:track` is an upsert — if an active sighting with the given `tempId` exists, it updates it (incrementing sighting count and optionally improving the best embedding); otherwise it creates a new sighting. Embeddings are passed as plain `number[]` over IPC and reconstructed as `Float32Array` in the main process.

### App Operations

| Channel | Direction | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `app:get-models-dir` | Renderer → Main | `string` (path to models directory) |
| `app:get-user-data-dir` | Renderer → Main | `string` (Electron userData path) |

### Preload surface (`window.emoryApi`)

The preload script exposes `window.emoryApi` — `face`, `db` (people, relationships, retention, embeddings), `encounter`, `unknown`, and `app` namespaces. Methods map 1:1 to channels in the tables above (including **`relationships.getAll`** → `db:relationships:get-all` and **`embeddings.*`** → `db:embeddings:*`).

| `emoryApi.unknown.nameAsPerson(id, personId)` | `unknown:name-as-person` |
| `emoryApi.unknown.findById(id)` | `unknown:find-by-id` |
| `emoryApi.app.getModelsDir()` | `app:get-models-dir` |
| `emoryApi.app.getUserDataDir()` | `app:get-user-data-dir` |

## IPC Data Serialization

`ArrayBuffer` does not survive Electron's IPC serialization natively. The preload bridge converts:

- **Outbound (renderer → main):** `ArrayBuffer` → `new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer)`
- **Inbound (main → preload):** `Uint8Array` → `Buffer.from(uint8Array)` in main process

`Float32Array` embeddings from `@emory/core` are serialized as plain arrays over IPC and reconstructed on the receiving side.

## Security Model

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `contextIsolation` | `true` | Prevents renderer from accessing Node.js APIs |
| `nodeIntegration` | `false` | Standard security practice |
| `sandbox` | `false` | Required for native module access (better-sqlite3) in preload |

## UI Layout

The app uses a tab-based layout with **seven** views. **Sidebar order:** Camera → People → Connections → Activity → Analytics → Embeddings → Settings.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Header (Brain icon, "Emory", model status) │
├────┬────────────────────────────────────────┤

## State Management

Four Zustand stores provide reactive state without prop drilling:

### `face.store.ts`
- `detections` — current frame's face detections (from `face:detect-only`)
- `matches` — matched faces with person names, similarity, and `matchMargin` (from `face:process-frame`)
- `isProcessing` — true while an identification request is in flight
- `modelStatus` — `'idle' | 'loading' | 'ready' | 'error'`
- `error` — optional user-visible error string (e.g. init failure), also shown in `StatusBar`
- `fpsCount` — detection loop frames per second
- `processingTimeMs` — last detection pass duration

### `people.store.ts`
- `people` — list of registered people (`isSelf` from DB; **You** badge on `PersonCard`), plus optional profile fields: `keyFacts`, `conversationStarters`, `importantDates`, `lastTopics`
- `ImportantDate` — `{ label: string, date: string }` type for date entries
- `PersonProfile` — grouped type for profile fields (`keyFacts`, `conversationStarters`, `importantDates`, `lastTopics`)
- `loadPeople()` — fetches all people from DB via IPC
- `addPerson()` — creates person and adds to local state
- `removePerson()` — deletes person and removes from local state

### `settings.store.ts`
- `activeTab` — current navigation tab (`'camera' | 'people' | 'connections' | 'activity' | 'analytics' | 'embeddings' | 'settings'`)
- Recognition settings: `autoLearnEnabled`, `detectionThreshold`, `matchThreshold`, `maxEmbeddingsPerPerson`
- Display settings: `showBoundingBoxes`, `showConfidence`, `showLandmarks`
- Performance settings: `identifyIntervalMs`, `detectCooldownMs`
- `resetToDefaults()` — restores all settings to factory values

### `activity.store.ts`
- `events` — capped list of recent activity events (max 100); `ActivityEvent` includes `type`, `personName`, `similarity`, `details`, etc.
- `autoLearnCount` — running count of successful auto-learns (session-oriented; cleared with events)
- `addEvent()` — appends a timestamped event
- `incrementAutoLearnCount()` — bumps the auto-learn counter (called from `WebcamFeed` on successful learn)
- `clearEvents()` — clears events **and** resets `autoLearnCount`

## Configuration

### Frame processing (`WebcamFeed` + `settings.store`)

Timing is **not** a single fixed “frame interval”: two loops run when the camera is active.

| Setting (default) | Role |
|---|---|
| `detectCooldownMs` (**50**) | Delay between `face:detect-only` calls (drives overlay tracks + FPS) |
| `identifyIntervalMs` (**1500**) | Interval for `face:process-frame` (identification + match updates) |

Other defaults: `autoLearnEnabled: true`, `detectionThreshold: 0.35`, `matchThreshold: 0.45` (aligned with `@emory/core` `DEFAULT_MATCH_THRESHOLD`; was `0.4`), `maxEmbeddingsPerPerson: 20` (UI; **main process** enforces hard caps for auto-learn as in [Active learning](#active-learning)).

`detectionThreshold` and `matchThreshold` from `settings.store` are synced to the main process via `face:update-thresholds` IPC. The store subscribes to its own state changes and pushes updated values whenever either threshold changes. The IPC handler stores these in module-level variables which are passed through to `faceService.detectFaces()` and `faceService.findBestMatch()` on every frame.

Webcam resolution: **640×480** ideal (`useWebcam`).

### Models Directory
ONNX model files must be placed in `{userData}/models/`:
- `det_10g.onnx` — SCRFD face detection
- `w600k_r50.onnx` — ArcFace face recognition

### Build Externals
Native modules are externalized from the Vite bundle:
- `better-sqlite3` (SQLite)
- `onnxruntime-node` (ONNX Runtime)
- `sharp` (image processing)

`sharp`, `onnxruntime-node`, and `better-sqlite3` are also listed as **direct** dependencies in `apps/desktop/package.json` (alongside `@emory/core` / `@emory/db`). The main bundle externalizes them (`electron.vite.config.ts`); Node must resolve them from the desktop package at Electron runtime, so transitive-only hoisting can produce `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for those imports.

### UI Stack
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (required for Vite-based CSS processing)
- **shadcn/ui** — tabs, tooltip, switch, slider, scroll-area, avatar, dropdown-menu, skeleton, progress, sheet, select, textarea, toggle, toggle-group, plus Button, Dialog, Input, Label, Badge, Card, Separator, Sonner, etc.
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Lucide React** for icons
- Dark theme via CSS variables (`.dark` class on `<html>`)

## Development

```bash
# From the monorepo root
bun install

# Run the desktop app
cd apps/desktop
bun run dev
```

The app uses `electron-vite` which provides:
- HMR for the renderer process
- Auto-restart for main process changes
- Proper externalization of native Node modules
